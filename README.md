## Usage
This application uses the node package `pm2` for daemonizing. You can install it via `(sudo) npm i -g pm2`. To account for system restarts, you have to run

```bash
pm2 startup systemd
```

and run the command that is generated.

Afterwards, Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in the necessary values. Then run `npm i` as well as `npm run install` and serve the application via reverse
proxy to the port entered in `.env` file via the webserver of your choice.

The application creates the file `database.sqlite` in the root folder, please make shure this file has adequate file permissions, as it contains user credentials.

### Uninstall service
To remove the daemonized application, simply run `npm run remove`.

### Administration
To administer the user database, run the maintenance command `npm run usermanager` which lets you add, remove and edit users via a command line wizard.

## Development
